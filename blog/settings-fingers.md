# How a default setting destroyed my fingers

I love my macbook pro, let me preface by saying that I think the laptop is by far the best on the market. Impressive specs backed by a high resolution screen, and the best part is a UNIX based operating system. This provides powerful toolkits, package managers, and command line interfaces to unlock the full potential of your computer.

This story begins like most do in my life, behind a glowing screen early in the morning tapping away at my favorite tool. The keyboard and touchpad on my Macbook Pro Retina 2013. She is worn but not broken, daily use has stripped away much of the vanish and shimmer from what was once a beautiful piece of hardware. A fraction of an inch of plastic protects the aluminum frame from certain destruction.

At some point I realized that most of my life involves tapping. Clicking this or that with my cursor before rapidly typing out a word or sentence. Over time it became second nature, I could type while carrying on a conversation. Eventually people find out the most fatiguing exercises while using a computer, and adopt shortcuts to make their lives easier. This not only saves time, but it minimizes the amount of keystrokes you spend day to day.

Why is this important you might ask? Well if you're using a laptop like me, each keystroke could be hurting your hands. My computer is not designed for heavy programming use like a desktop PC, mechanical keyboard, and a fancy computer mouse. This computer was designed to be thin and functional. Over three years of daily touchpad use, the tip of my right index finger is completely numb.
